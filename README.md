## 3D pictures cloud

### Description:

I was looking to find an alternative way to display some visualization and wasn't able to find anything that is interactive
and allows user to quickly explore possibilities without using flash so I made this picture cloud using Jquery based on this [article](http://patrickroux.ca/developpement/un-nuage-de-tag-en-3d-sans-flash-cest-possible-avec-jquery-279).

You could check video.webm to see it in action or use [demo link](https://cdn.rawgit.com/logan169/3D-picture-cloud/8d60f5cf/index.html#)
